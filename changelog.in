Staged propagation for domain-consistent absolute value propagator

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   minor

Fixed bug in fixpoint detection of bounds-consistent abs
propagator.

What:	new
Rank:	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Added new constraint channel for variable/value channeling
between to variable arrays.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:	change
Rank:	minor
[DESCRIPTION]
All distinct propagators raise an exception if a variable occurs
multiply in its arguments.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What:	change
Rank:	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Renamed the set propagators minElement to min, maxElement to max,
and channelVarVal to channel.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What: 	performace
Rank: 	major
[DESCRIPTION]
Improved initialization of domain-consistent distinct propagator,
in common cases for distinct this can save up to 10% runtime.

Rank:   minor
Bug:    33
Thanks: Olof Sivertsson
[DESCRIPTION]
Slice-operation now returns elements in right order.

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Bug:    32
Thanks: Olof Sivertsson
[DESCRIPTION]
Possible array-out-of bounds access fixed for MiniModel::Matrix.

[RELEASE]
Version:	1.0.1
Date:		2006-03-01
[DESCRIPTION]
Maintenance release including some additions of domain-consistent
propagators and a fix for a serious bug in reified linear
inequalities.

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Changed default copying recomputation distance to 8.

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Thanks: Olof Sivertsson
[DESCRIPTION]
(In-)Equations with an int on the left hand side (like 9==x) were
translated with a wrong sign (as -9==x).

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Bug:    31
[DESCRIPTION]
The preprocessor macro NDEBUG for disabling assertions is no longer
put into config.icc. Without this fix, user programs could not use
assert if Gecode was compiled with NDEBUG.

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The post functions for linear expressions and relations also take
an integer consistency level as optional argument.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   new
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Added domain-consistent linear equalities.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Bug:	30
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed fixpoint detection for ternary min and max.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed subsumtion detection for regular with multiple variable occurences.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Cost computation for sortedness has been changed from static to
dynamic (taking into account the variable reduction the
propagator can perform).

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Global cardinality changed to non-staged version.  Further
inference for cardinality variables added.  Parts of the graph
structure for the domain-consistent propagator have been revised
so as to avoid unnecessary propagation in case of fixed
cardinalities and to allow better staging for the
propagator. Revision of propagation for fixed cardinalities has
also been applied to bounds-consistent propagator.

[DESCRIPTION]
The strongly connected components represented by the permutation
variables in the extended version of Sortedness has been fixed

[DESCRIPTION]
Examples now use per default the recomputation settings as
defined in the search module.
