[RELEASE]
Version:	1.x.y
Date:		upcoming
[DESCRIPTION]
Next release.

[ENTRY]
Module: set
What: bug
Rank: minor
Thanks: Patrick Pekczynski
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed off-by-one bug in SetVarImp::lubMinN and SetVarImp::lubMaxN.

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Thanks: Olof Sivertsson
[DESCRIPTION]
(In-)Equations were still not correct with respect to the sign.

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Bug:    33
Thanks: Olof Sivertsson
[DESCRIPTION]
Slice-operation now returns elements in the right order.

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Bug:    32
Thanks: Olof Sivertsson
[DESCRIPTION]
Possible array-out-of bounds access fixed for MiniModel::Matrix.

[ENTRY]
Module: example
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Added redundant constraint to social golfers example.

[RELEASE]
Version:	1.0.1
Date:		2006-03-01
[DESCRIPTION]
Maintenance release including some additions of domain-consistent
propagators and a fix for a serious bug in reified linear
inequalities.

[ENTRY]
Module: search
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Changed default copying recomputation distance to 8.

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Thanks: Olof Sivertsson
[DESCRIPTION]
(In-)Equations with an int on the left hand side (like 9==x) were
translated with a wrong sign (as -9==x).

[ENTRY]
Module: other
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Bug:    31
[DESCRIPTION]
The preprocessor macro NDEBUG for disabling assertions is no longer
put into config.icc. Without this fix, user programs could not use
assert if Gecode was compiled with NDEBUG.

[ENTRY]
Module: minimodel
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The post functions for linear expressions and relations also take
an integer consistency level as optional argument.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   new
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Added domain-consistent linear equalities.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
Bug:	30
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed fixpoint detection for ternary min and max.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   bug
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed subsumtion detection for regular with multiple variable occurences.

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Cost computation for sortedness has been changed from static to
dynamic (taking into account the variable reduction the
propagator can perform).

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Global cardinality changed to non-staged version.  Further
inference for cardinality variables added.  Parts of the graph
structure for the domain-consistent propagator have been revised
so as to avoid unnecessary propagation in case of fixed
cardinalities and to allow better staging for the
propagator. Revision of propagation for fixed cardinalities has
also been applied to bounds-consistent propagator.

[ENTRY]
Module:		int
What:		new
Rank:		major
[DESCRIPTION]
Added domain-consistent version of the absolute value propagator.

[ENTRY]
Module:		other
What:		performance
Rank:		major
[DESCRIPTION]
Switch assertions off in optimized builds with Microsoft's C++ compiler.

[ENTRY]
Module:		int
What:		bug
Rank:		major
Bug:		29
Thanks:		Dominik Brill
[DESCRIPTION]
Fixed a very serious bug in the reified linear inequality propagator.

[ENTRY]
Module:		other
What:		bug
Rank:		minor
Thanks:		Filip Konvicka
[DESCRIPTION]
Removed some compiler warnings for the Microsoft compiler with -W3.

[ENTRY]
Module:		int
What:		bug
Rank:		major
Bug:		27
[DESCRIPTION]
The strongly connected components represented by the permutation
variables in the extended version of Sortedness has been fixed
restoring bounds consistency on the permutation variables.

[ENTRY]
Module:		other
What:		change
Rank:		minor
Bug:		24
[DESCRIPTION]
The soname for libraries on Linux is now set properly, as well as the
version information on Darwin (Mac OS).

Module:		other
What:		change
Rank:		minor
Bug:		25
[DESCRIPTION]
The build system has been updated to support building both static and
shared libraries at the same time on Unix-like systems.

[ENTRY]
Module:		example
What:		change
Rank:		minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Examples now use per default the recomputation settings as
defined in the search module.

[RELEASE]
