[RELEASE]
Version:	1.2.0
Date:		upcoming
[DESCRIPTION]
This release makes quite some drastic changes to how propagators
and branchings are deleted: instead of using destructors they use
a dispose that allows to pass a home space during deletion (we
will use this ifrastructure measure to speed up cloning
considerably a little later). Moreover the directory structure
has changed on popular request so that all include files are to
be found in a gecode subdirectory. Apart from that, some small
fixes and extensions due to requests.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   performance
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
More aggresive inlining for cancelling subscriptions.

[ENTRY]
Module: search

Rank:   minor
Bug:	39
[DESCRIPTION]

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
The branch member function for branchings now also takes a home space
as argument.

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Cancelling subscriprions on views and variable implementations now
require also a home space (this has become possible due to not using
destructors but ordinary "dispose" member functions).

[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   change
Rank:   major
[DESCRIPTION]
Actors (propagators and branchings) do not any longer use destructors
but a "dispose" member function that takes a home space as argument
and must return the size of the actor.
Important: this requires that dispose member functions from super-classes
and class members are called explicitly!
	
[ENTRY]
Module: kernel
What:   new
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Spaces can be queried for number of propagators and branchings.

Module: example
What:   change
Rank:   minor
[DESCRIPTION]
Sudoku example generalized to arbitrarily sized Sudokus.

[RELEASE]
Version:	1.1.0
Date:		2006-04-10
[DESCRIPTION]
This minor release adds some new constraints (see below), adds support
for stopping search engines based on definable criterias, and some other
small fixes. Most notably, the test infrastructure has been extended to
also check whether propagators correctly claim that they have computed
a fixpoint (now all invariants a propagator must obey in Gecode are covered
by the test infrastructure). This has lead to many small fixes.

propagator can perform).

[ENTRY]
Module: int
What:   change

propagator. Revision of propagation for fixed cardinalities has
also been applied to bounds-consistent propagator.
